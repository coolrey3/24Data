# 24Data Website Recreation

This Project was intended as a skill test and the outline was to re-create this website from the images provided.

# Frameworks Used
I used BootStrap 4 and JQuery along with the JQuery validation package to add detail to the error messages output during form validation.


# Issues Encountered
When doing the form validation i ran in to an issue using glyphicons and had to scrap the original method of form validation i was using. As glyphicons are no longer included in Bootstrap 4, the validation was not working as expected with the native rule validation in JQuery.
