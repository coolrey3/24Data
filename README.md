# 24Data Website Recreation

# The Proccess
This Project was intended as a skill test and the outline was to re-create this website from the images provided. I decided to start with the html and css and use bootstrap grid to start the general wireframe. After styling the page  for desktop i started with the mobile view. 

 to add detail to the error messages output during form validation.

# Libraries / Frameworks Used
### BootStrap 4 
### JQuery along
####    JQuery validation 

# Highlights

# Issues Encountered
When doing the form validation i ran in to an issue using glyphicons and had to scrap the original method of form validation i was using. As glyphicons are no longer included in Bootstrap 4, the validation was not working as expected with the native rule validation in JQuery.
